# FUTURE_DS_03
College Event Feedback Analysis – Internship Project Uses data science to improve campus life! Learn how to turn student feedback into actionable insights using real-world tools like Google Colab, pandas, and TextBlob — no coding background needed.
## Project Overview
College events like tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities collect feedback — but are we using it meaningfully?

In this project, interns will analyze text and rating-based feedback submitted by students after attending campus events. You’ll work with simulated or real Google Forms data (CSV) and use basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

## What You’ll Do
✅ Clean and prepare feedback data (from a Google Form export)
✅ Analyze ratings (1–5 scale) to find patterns of satisfaction
✅ Use NLP tools to score sentiment in comments (positive/neutral/negative)
✅ Visualize trends with beautiful charts and graphs
✅ Suggest improvements for future events

## Skills You’ll Gain
Data cleaning & preparation with pandas
Sentiment analysis using TextBlob or VADER
Creating bar charts, pie charts, word clouds for reports
Interpreting survey data to help make real decisions
Working in Google Colab (no software installation!)

## Tools & Libraries
Tool	Purpose
Google Colab	Online coding (no setup needed)
pandas	Data manipulation
seaborn/matplotlib	Visualization
TextBlob / VADER	Sentiment analysis (NLP)

 ## Final Deliverable
✅ A clean, well-commented Jupyter Notebook (or Colab link)
✅ A mini-report/dashboard with:

Graphs of ratings
Sentiment analysis summary
Key recommendations for event organizers
